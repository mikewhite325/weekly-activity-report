 - [Summary](#summary)

### Big Three

- Learned how to properly test impact of disturbances

- Obtained 30% gain margin for PI controller

- Hopefully successfully flight test

### Objective

Do mock flight demo for February 19th debut demo.

### Work I Did

Continual testing to optimize system gains.


### Meetings

  - Mujahid gave me guidance on how to set up a proper gain margin to allow for a more stable system


### Summary/Remarks:

- The instability of last weeks test on moving targets was due to having both KI and KP tuned too high
- This was fixed by having the tracking oscillate and then tune the gain down to 30% of that gain the caused the oscillatory response  
-
-


### Follow up

- Ask Mujahid for further guidance on how to help Ki track moving targets
